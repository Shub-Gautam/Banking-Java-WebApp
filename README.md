# Banking-Java-WebApp

This is a banking App  which is build on top of banking project available for open use on Javapoint (https://www.javatpoint.com/online-banking-project). 
Since the Javapoint's Banking project depends on local MySQL Database and have some security flaws, so I decided to modify it to make it more useable and deployable.

## Our Goal :
* Change Local MySQL Database to MongoDB Atlas Database (Cloud-Based)
* Fix security issues like secure datatransfer while requesting.
* Enhancing UI using Bootstrap and modern framework.
* Make it cloud deployable.
